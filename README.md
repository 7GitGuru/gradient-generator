### Gradient generator
It is a simple web application that generates CSS gradients when you click the "randomize" button. It allows users to create a gradient and select its type (linear or radial), direction and shape. The generated CSS code can then be copied to the clipboard and used in any project.

### Usage
To use the gradient generator, simply open the [index.html](https://7gitguru.github.io/gradient-generator/) file in your browser. An interface will open allowing you to select colors and gradient options. The preview will update in real time.

### Contribution
